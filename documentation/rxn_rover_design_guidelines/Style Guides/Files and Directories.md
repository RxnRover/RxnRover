# Directory and File Guidelines

Last Updated: 2021-03-23

## Purpose
To provide conventions for naming and usage of directories and files within Rxn Rover and its plugins.

## Directories

### Naming

- Use lowercase to indicate that a folder is generic across projects. From [Viewpoint article](https://www.viewpointusa.com/TM/ar/organization-and-naming-for-labview-projects/).

## Files

### Naming
#### LabVIEW

LabVIEW-specific files, such as projects, libraries, and VIs will be named so the following rule provides a complete description of the contents of a file. This rule was suggested by [JÃžB](https://forums.ni.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/123634) on the [NI forums](https://forums.ni.com/t5/LabVIEW/Naming-conventions/m-p/2198748/highlight/true?profile.language=en#M704033).
