Recover Temporary Data
===================================

To recover data created during a "Continue without Experiment" run, navigate
to the :ref:`temporary directory <lv-tmp-directory>` and find the 
:ref:`Rxn Rover directory <which-rxnrover-tmp-directory>` corresponding to the 
desired experiment.

.. hint::
   
   Finding your temporary file can be difficult, since they are named with 
   random numbers! Try using the "Date modified" to identify your experiment.
