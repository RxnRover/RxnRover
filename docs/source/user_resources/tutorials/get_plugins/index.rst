Get Existing Plugins
====================

This tutorial will walk through acquiring existing plugins from the 
`Rxn Rover Plugin Catalog <https://rxnrover.github.io/PluginCatalog>`__ and 
installing the plugins so they are discoverable by Rxn Rover.

.. note::
   
   For information on creating your own plugin, see :ref:`Creating a New Plugin
   <create-new-plugin>`.

Where can I acquire plugins?
----------------------------

A list of existing first- and third-party plugins exists in the 
`Rxn Rover Plugin Catalog <https://rxnrover.github.io/PluginCatalog>`__. Browse 
the listings or use the search feature to find your desired plugins, and 
follow the acquisition instructions included with each plugin listing to 
download it.

Where should downloaded plugins go?
-----------------------------------

Typical installation of a plugin just requires moving the downloaded plugin
to your ``<documents>/RxnRover/Plugins`` directory, where ``<documents>`` is
the location of a user's Documents directory for your operating system. Rxn 
Rover will check this directory and load plugins based on their 
``plugin.conf`` files.

.. note::
   
   Each plugin, especially third-party plugins, may have additional or 
   different installation instructions. Make sure you thoroughly read
   each plugin description!

.. note::
   
   See :ref:`Rxn Rover Plugin Directories <rxnrover-plugin-directories>` for
   more information about the different locations Rxn Rover checks for plugins.
